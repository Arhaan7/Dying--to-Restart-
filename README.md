Dying to Restart (Board Game) 
Simple board game. The board chip has to land on the exact last spot to finish the game. 
The rules are that if you roll a 3, you get a double turn, meaning you roll a 6. 
If you roll a 4, your turn is skipped. 
This code is written in python and uses tools from pygame to be implemented.
